# FiFi-SDR - Firmware

For a project overview see [FiFi-SDR Homepage](https://o28.sischa.net/fifisdr/trac)

FiFi-SDR was presented as a kit project back in 2010. An SVN repository exists on the project homepage, where you can find a complete set of documentation for hardware and software.

This GitHub project contains the firmware project only. It was created to provide a fix for an issue that popped up recently with the GCC V10 compiler.
